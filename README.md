# 🪨 Rock Type Classification with Decision Tree

This is a simple data mining project developed using Python that classifies rock types based on geographical and environmental features such as inclination, species cover, and surface roughness.

The application provides a GUI interface to:
- Load your Excel dataset,
- Visualize key distributions and correlations,
- Run a Decision Tree classification model,
- Automatically generate and save performance visuals (confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importances, etc.).
